# Travel Anchors

This mod brings Travel Anchors from EnderIO into a standalone mod.

Forked from [CastCrafter](https://github.com/castcrafter/travel_anchors) with some minor changes for my personal [Create Chronicles: Bosses and Beyond](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-chronicles-bosses-and-beyond) pack.

## Latest changes

### Short-range teleport
- Removed block snapping 
- Optionally keep velocity
- Added separate keybind (in addition to sneak+click)
- Configurable cooldown
- Added compatibility for Iron's Spells and Spellbooks
