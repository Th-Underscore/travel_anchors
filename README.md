# Travel Anchors

This Mod brings Travel Anchors from EnderIO into a standalone Mod.

Forked from [CastCrafter](https://github.com/castcrafter/travel_anchors) with some minor changes for my personal [Create Chronicles: Bosses and Beyond](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/create-chronicles-bosses-and-beyond) pack.

Latest changes:
- Removed block snapping
- Optionally keep velocity after short-range teleport
- Added separate short-range teleport keybind (in addition to sneak+click)
